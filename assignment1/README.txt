All the analysis are done in Weka GUI. The URLs of datasets are attache in the report in the referrence of the report.

For data preprocessing, resample and removepecentage filter is usued with no replacement option to 70-30 split for original dataset. THen we got training and test dat.

10, 20, 30, ..., 90% of the training data is generated by remove pencentage filter. Training and test results can be accesed by Weka explorer and experiment.

J48 is used for decision tree. IBK is used for KNN. AdaboostM1 and J48 are used for boosting. SMO for SVM and Multilayerpeceptron is for Neural Network. Learning curve results are generated by Weka experiment and plot out by Excel.

Results spreadsheet and accuracy table for different classifiers are in the folder. Two datasets are also included.
